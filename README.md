README in progress, I will add tips and tricks about the project later on maybe idk

Philosophers, mandatory part:

The mandatory part of Philosophers is honestly the trickiest one, you have to make philosophers live using threads and mutexes.
The hardest part for me was to make them stop easily as you dont have a pthread_stop function or something like it.

Philosophers, bonus part:

The bonus part was really easy, once you understand what a semaphore is its really easy.
Being able to just kill() the forks makes it so much easier to stop the simulation
